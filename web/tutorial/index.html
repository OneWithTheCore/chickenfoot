<h3>Tutorial</h3>

Welcome to the Chickenfoot interactive tutorial. When you see text in a box like the one below, 
it is a piece of Chickenfoot code (which we call <b>Chickenscratch</b>) that can
be executed from the Chickenfoot Script Editor.

<pre class="example">
// A line that begins with two slashes is a comment.
// Comments are not executable code,
// but they can help document what the code does.

// prints "hello world" to the Output pane
output("hello world")
</pre>

To introduce you to Chickenfoot,
the interactive tutorial consists of a series of sample pages.
Each sample page will show a real web site, such as Google,
and a snippet of Chickenscratch to run on that web site.
This will expose you to the various <a href="../api.html">commands</a>
that are available in Chickenfoot.
