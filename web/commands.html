<p>Chickenfoot programs are written in Javascript, using the Javascript 1.5 interpreter
  built into Mozilla Firefox. As a result, Chickenfoot users have access to the
  full expressiveness of a high-level scripting language, with a prototype-instance
  object system, lexically scoped procedures, dynamic typing, and a rich class
  library. </p>
  
<p>Because Chickenfoot uses Javascript, web developers can easily transfer their
  knowledge of Javascript from web page development over to Chickenfoot. Chickenfoot
  predefines the same variables available to Javascript in web pages - e.g.,
  <tt>window</tt>, <tt>document</tt>, <tt>location</tt>, <tt>frames</tt>, <tt>history</tt> -
  so that Javascript code written for inclusion <em>inside </em> a web page can
  also be used as a Chickenfoot script <em>outside </em> the web page. Javascript
  has its own ways of visiting new pages (<tt>location</tt>), manipulating form controls
  (<tt>document.forms</tt>), and modifying page content (using the Document Object Model,
  or DOM ?). These
  mechanisms can be used by Chickenfoot scripts in addition to the Chickenfoot
  commands described in the next few sections. We have found that using the native
  Javascript mechanisms generally require reading and understanding a web page's
  HTML source. But by providing access to them, Chickenfoot provides a smooth
  escape mechanism for script developers that need to do something more low-level. </p>

<p>All current web browsers, including Firefox, implement a security model for
  Javascript to protect web users from malicious downloaded scripts. A major
  part of this security model is the <em>same-origin policy </em>, which prevents
  Javascript code downloaded from one web server from manipulating a web page
  downloaded from a different server. This restriction is clearly too severe
  for Chickenfoot, since its primary purpose is integrating and customizing multiple
  web sites. As a result, Chickenfoot scripts run at a privileged level, where
  they have access to the entire web browser, all pages it visits, and the user's
  filesystem and network. Users must trust Chickenfoot code as much as they trust
  any other desktop application. As a result, Chickenfoot scripts cannot be embedded
  in downloadable web pages like other Javascript. But Chickenfoot code <em>can </em> inject
  new behavior into downloaded pages, which is explained in more detail later. </p>

<h4 id="pattern">Pattern Matching <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>
<p>Pattern matching is a fundamental operation in Chickenfoot. To operate on
  a web page component, most commands take a pattern describing that page component.<br />
  Chickenfoot supports two kinds of patterns: <em>keyword patterns </em> and <em>text
  constraint patterns </em>. A keyword pattern consists of a string of keywords
  that are searched in the page to locate a page component, followed by the type
  of the component to be found. For example, <tt>"Search form"</tt> matches a
  form containing the keyword Search, and <tt>"Go button"</tt> matches a button
  with the word Go in
  its label. The component type is one of a small set of primitive names, including
  <tt>link</tt>, <tt>button</tt>, <tt>textbox</tt>, <tt>checkbox</tt>, <tt>radiobutton</tt>, <tt>listbox</tt>, and <tt>table</tt>. When
  a keyword pattern is used by a form manipulation command, the type of page
  component is implicit and can be omitted. For example, <tt>click("Go")</tt> searches
  for a hyperlink or button with the keyword "Go" in its label. Case is not significant,
  so <tt>click("go")</tt> has the same effect. </p>

<p>A text constraint pattern combines a library of primitive patterns (such as
  <tt>link</tt>, <tt>textbox</tt>, or <tt>paragraph</tt>), literal strings (such
  as <tt>"Go"</tt>), and relational
  operators (e.g., <tt>in</tt>, <tt>contains</tt>, <tt>just before</tt>, <tt>just
  after</tt>, <tt>starts</tt>, <tt>ends</tt>).
  Text constraint patterns have been described in more detail previously. Text
  constraint patterns are generally used to identify parts of a page for modification
  and extraction, although they can also be used for form manipulation. </p>

<p>The <tt>find</tt> command takes a pattern of either kind and searches for it in the
  current page, e.g.: </p>

<pre>  find("Search form") 
  find("link in bold") </pre>

<p><tt>find</tt> returns a <tt>Match</tt> object which represents the first match to the pattern
  and provides access to the rest of the matches. Here are some common idioms
  using <tt>find</tt> : </p>

<pre>  // test whether a pattern matches
  if (find(<em>pattern </em>).hasMatch) { ... }
  // count number of matches
  find(<em>pattern </em>).count
  // iterate through all matches
  for (m=find(<em>pattern </em>); m.hasMatch;m = m.next) { ... } </pre>

<p>A <tt>Match</tt> object represents a contiguous region of a web page, so it also provides
  properties for extracting that region. If <tt>m</tt> is a <tt>Match</tt> object, then <tt>m.text</tt>  returns the plain text it represents - i.e., the text that would be obtained
  by copying that region of the rendered web page and pasting it to a text editor
  that ignored formatting. Similarly, <tt>m.html</tt> returns the source HTML of the region,
  which is useful for extracting the region with formatting intact. Finally,
  <tt>m.element</tt> returns the DOM <tt>Element</tt> object represented by the region, if the
  region contains a single outermost element. This <tt>element</tt> can be used to get
  and set element attributes, e.g.: </p>

<pre>  find("link").element.href </pre>

<p>The <tt>find</tt> command is not only a global procedure, but also a method of <tt>Match</tt>  and <tt>Document</tt>. Invoking <tt>find</tt> on one of these objects constrains it to return
  only matches within the page or part of a page represented by the object. Here
  are some common idioms: </p>

<pre>// nested finds
  for (t=find("table"); t.hasMatch; t = t.next) {
    r = t.find("row");
    ...
  }

  // find in a page not currently showing
  otherDocument.find(<em>pattern</em>) </pre>

<h4 id="forms">Clicking and Form Manipulation <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>

<p>The next few commands allow Chickenfoot scripts to click on hyperlinks and
  fill in and submit forms. </p>

<p>The <tt>click</tt> command takes a pattern describing a hyperlink or button on the
  current page and causes the same effect as if the user had clicked on it. For
  example, these commands click on various parts of the Google home page: </p>

<pre>  click("Advanced Search") // a hyperlink
  click("I'm Feeling Lucky") // a button </pre>

<p>Keyword patterns do not need to exactly match the label of the button or hyperlink,
  but they do need to be unambiguous. Thus, <tt>click("Lucky")</tt> would suffice to match
  the I'm Feeling Lucky button, but in this case, <tt>click("Search")</tt> would be ambiguous
  between the Google Search button and the Advanced Search link, and hence would
  throw an exception. (Exact matches take precedence over partial matches, however,
  so if there were a single button labeled "Search", then the <tt>click</tt> command would
  succeed.) Buttons and links labeled by an image can be matched by keywords
  mentioned in their ALT text, if any. The keyword matching algorithm is described
  in more detail later in this paper. </p>

<p>The <tt>click</tt> command can take a <tt>Match</tt> object instead of a pattern, if the button
  or hyperlink to be clicked has already been found. For example, to identify
  a button using a text constraint pattern, the user might write this: </p>

<pre>  click(find("button just after textbox")) </pre>

<p>The <tt>enter</tt> command enters a value into a textbox. Like <tt>click</tt>, it
  takes a keyword pattern to identify the textbox, but in this case, the keywords
  are taken from the textbox's caption or other visible labels near the textbox.
  For example, to interact with the Amazon login page, a script might say: </p>

<pre>  enter("e-mail address", "rm@mit.edu")
  enter("password", password) </pre>

<p>When the page contains only one textbox in the page, which is often true for
  search forms, the keyword pattern can be omitted. For example, this sequence
  does a search on Google: </p>

<pre>  enter("uist 2005") 
  click("Google Search") </pre>

<p>Checkboxes and radio buttons are controlled by the <tt>check</tt> and <tt>uncheck</tt> commands,
  which take a keyword pattern that describes the checkbox: </p>

<pre>  check("Yes, I have a password") 
  uncheck("Remember Me") </pre>

<p>Finally, the <tt>pick</tt> command makes a selection from a listbox or drop-down box
  (which are both instantiations of the HTML <tt>&lt;select&gt;</tt> element). The simplest
  form of <tt>pick</tt> merely identifies the choice by a keyword pattern: </p>

<pre>  pick("California") </pre>

<p>If only one choice in any listbox or drop-down on the page matches the keywords
  (the common case), then that choice is made. If the choice is not unique, <tt>pick</tt>  can take two keyword patterns, the first identifying a listbox or dropdown
  by keywords from its caption, and the second identifying the choice within
  the listbox: </p>

<pre>  pick("State", "California") </pre>

<p>Like <tt>find</tt>, all the clicking and form manipulation commands are also
  methods of <tt>Match</tt> and <tt>Document</tt>. so that the keyword search can be constrained
  to a particular part of a page: </p>

<pre>  f = find("Directions form")
  f.enter("address", "32 Vassar St")
  f.enter("zip", "02139") 
  f.click("Get Directions") </pre>

<p>The form manipulation commands described so far permit setting the value of
  a form widget, which is the most common case for web automation. To read the
  current value of a widget, a script can use <tt>find</tt> to locate it, and then access
  the value of its <tt>Element</tt> object in conventional Javascript fashion, e.g.: </p>

<pre>  find("address textbox").element.value </pre>

<p>Chickenfoot also provides a <tt>reset</tt> command which resets a form to its default
  values, though reset is rarely needed. </p>

<h4 id="navigation">Navigation and Page Loading <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>

<p>In addition to loading pages by clicking on links and submitting forms, Chickenfoot
  scripts can jump directly to a URL using the <tt>go</tt> command: </p>

<pre>  go("http://www.google.com") </pre>

<p>If the string is not a valid URL, <tt>go</tt> automatically prefixes it with "http://". </p>

<p>Conventional browser navigation operations are also available as Chickenfoot
  commands: <tt>back</tt>, <tt>forward</tt>, and <tt>reload</tt>. </p>

<p>To retrieve a page without displaying it, the <tt>fetch</tt> command can be used. It
  returns a <tt>Document</tt> object representing the invisible page: </p>

<pre>  google = fetch("www.google.com") </pre>

<p>The Javascript <tt>with</tt> statement is convenient for performing a sequence of operations
  on an invisible page, by implicitly setting the context for Chickenfoot pattern
  matching and form manipulation: </p>

<pre>  with (fetch("www.google.com")) {
    enter("syzygy");
    click("Google Search");
    n = find("number just after about").text
  } </pre>

<p>Pages retrieved by <tt>fetch</tt>, <tt>go</tt>, or <tt>click</tt> are loaded
  asynchronously by the browser, while the Chickenfoot script continues to run.
  Thus, a script can fire off several <tt>fetch</tt> requests in parallel, without
  forcing each request to complete before the next one starts. When a subsequent
  Chickenfoot command needs to access the content of a page, such as <tt>find</tt>, the
  command automatically blocks until the page is fully loaded. The <tt>wait</tt> and <tt>ready</tt>  commands make this blocking available to programmatic control. Both commands
  take a <tt>Document</tt> object or an array of <tt>Documents</tt> as an argument. With no arguments,
  the default is the current page. <tt>Wait</tt> blocks until at least one of the specified
  pages is fully loaded, and returns that page. <tt>Ready</tt> returns a loaded page only
  if it has already completed, otherwise it immediately returns <tt>null</tt>. </p>

<h4 id="modification">Page Modification <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>

<p>Chickenfoot offers three primitive commands for changing the content of web
  pages: <tt>insert</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, and <tt>replace</tt>. </p>

<p>The <tt>insert</tt> command takes two arguments: a location on a page and a fragment
  of web page content that should be inserted at that location. In its simplest
  form, the location is a text constraint pattern, and the web page content is
  simply a string of HTML: </p>

<pre>  insert("just before textbox", "&lt;b&gt;Search: &lt;/b&gt;") </pre>

<p>The location can also be derived from a <tt>Match</tt> object, but it must represent
  a single point in the page, not a range of content. The <tt>before</tt> and <tt>after</tt> commands
  can be used to reduce one of these objects to a point: </p>

<pre>  t = find("textbox")
  insert(after(t), "&lt;b&gt;Search: &lt;/b&gt;") </pre>

<p>The page content to be inserted can also be a <tt>Match</tt> object, allowing content
  to be extracted from another page and inserted in this one: </p>

<pre>  map = mapquest.find("image")
  insert("just after Directions", map) </pre>

<p>The <tt>remove</tt> command removes page content identified by its argument, which
  can be a text constraint pattern or <tt>Match</tt> object. For example: </p>

<pre>  remove("Sponsored Links cell") </pre>

<p>The replace command replaces one chunk of page content with another. It is
  often used to wrap page content around an existing element: </p>

<pre>  keyword = find("syzygy")
  replace(keyword, "&lt;b&gt;"+keyword+"&lt;/b&gt;") </pre>

<h4 id="widgets">Widgets <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>

<p>When a Chickenfoot script needs to present a user interface, it can create
  links and buttons and insert them directly into a web page. Hyperlinks are
  created by the <tt>Link</tt> constructor, which takes a chunk of HTML to display inside
  the hyperlink and an event handler to run when the link is clicked: </p>

<pre>  new Link("&lt;b&gt;Show All&lt;/b&gt;", showAll) </pre>

<p>The event handler can be either a string of Chickenfoot code (like the <tt>onclick</tt>  attribute
  in HTML) or a Javascript function object. Buttons are created similarly by
  the <tt>Button</tt> constructor. </p>

<p>Other widgets can be created by inserting HTML, e.g.: </p>

<pre>  insert(..., "&lt;input type=checkbox&gt;") </pre>

<p>If an <tt>onclick</tt> attribute is included in this HTML element, however, the code
  it contains will execute like conventional, untrusted Javascript code downloaded
  with the page. Commands defined by Chickenfoot would be unavailable to it.
  To add a Chickenfoot handler to a button created from HTML, one can use the
  <tt>onClick</tt> command: </p>

<pre>  onClick(button, showAll) </pre>
</dl>
