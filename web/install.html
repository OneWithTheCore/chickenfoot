You will have to restart Firefox after installation
for the changes to take effect. (This means that you
will have to close <b>ALL</b> of your Firefox windows
in order to restart.)

<b>Optional:</b> To use <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/lapis/">LAPIS</a> patterns 
in Chickenfoot, install the LAPIS extension below, which defines the TC class.  
Some of the examples on the Chickenfoot web site currently depend on the TC class, but we are 
working to eliminate this requirement, because LAPIS is too slow for convenient use.
