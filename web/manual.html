<h3>User Guide and Tutorial</h3>

This guide shows you how to get started with Chickenfoot, provides a tour of its user interface, and 
highlights some of the most useful commands and pattern matching techniques for Chickenfoot scripting.

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

Chickenfoot appears as a sidebar in Firefox.  To make the Chickenfoot sidebar appear, 
either press <b>F8</b>, or use the menus to go to View &gt;&gt; Sidebar &gt;&gt; Chickenfoot.  The sidebar
should look something like this:

<img src="images/simple_screenshot.png" style="margin-right: 30px" align="LEFT" />

<p />

The top half of the sidebar is an editor where you can type in Chickenfoot script commands and
run them.  The bottom half displays output and errors from Chickenfoot scripts.

<p />

To learn how to use Chickenfoot, we're going to work through a simple example: a script that automates
Google.  We'll build up the script one line at a time.  You may find it convenient to create a new Firefox
tab (press <b>Ctrl-T</b>) for running the example code below, so that you don't lose your place here.

<p />
First, the script visits Google using the <tt>go</tt> command.  
Copy this code into the Chickenfoot script editor and press the Run button (or press <b>Ctrl-R</b>):
<pre>
go("google.com")
</pre>

click("advanced search")

<h3>Chickenfoot Sidebar</h3>

Below is a screenshot of Chickenfoot with an explanation of its UI
and an example of how to use it.

<p/>


On the left is a screen shot of the Chickenfoot Script editor
which appears as a sidebar in Firefox. There is a toolbar with
a series of icons with a large text area below it.
Under that is the Debug area, which consists of another toolbar/text area
combo.

<p/>

The first three icons are the standard <b>Open</b>,
<b>Save</b>, and <b>Save As</b> options that allow you
to open and save script files (which ought to have a <b>.js</b>
file extension, but are not required to).

<p/>

The next icon is the <b>Run</b> icon which will run the script
in the editor window. You can also use <b>Alt+R</b> as a shortcut
to run the script.

<p/>

The icon on the far right of the editor toolbar will <b>Clear</b>
the editor window. If you are editing a particular file, then the file
name will appear between the Clear icon and the other icons.

<p/>

Below the editor toolbar is the editor window. This is where you
can develop your scripts. Use <b>Alt+C</b> to give the editor window
keyboard focus. Anything that is valid Javascript is valid in Chickenfoot,
including "trusted" Javascript. In addition to regular Javascript,
Chickenfoot provides a set of <a href="/commands/docs.html">additional commands</a>
that may be helpful in writing scripts.

<p/>

Below the editor window is the debug area. Like the editor window,
it has a button that you can click to clear the window.
To programmatically clear the window, you call call <b>clear()</b>
in the editor window. This may be convenient to use when testing
out scripts.

<p/>

Try the following for an example of how to use Chickenfoot:

<ol>

<li>Open <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com</a> in Firefox.</li>

<li>Hit <b>F8</b> to open the Chickenfoot sidebar.
(You can also open it by using <b>View -> Sidebar -> Chickenfoot</b>.)</li>

<li>Type something into the search box.</li>

<li>Type <code>click('Google Search');</code> in the textarea in the sidebar.</li>

<li>Hit the <b>Run</b> button (or Alt+R) to execute your script.</li>

<li>Watch in awe as the <b>Google Search</b> button is fired.</li>

</ol>


<h3 id="home">Commands</h3>
<p>Chickenfoot commands are broken up by their intended effect. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#pattern">Pattern Matching</a></li>
  <li><a href="#forms">Clicking and Form Manipulation</a></li>
  <li><a href="#navigation">Navigation and Page Loading</a></li>
  <li><a href="#modification">Page Modification</a></li>
  <li><a href="#widgets">Widgets</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>

<p>Chickenfoot programs are written in Javascript, using the Javascript 1.5 interpreter
  built into Mozilla Firefox. As a result, Chickenfoot users have access to the
  full expressiveness of a high-level scripting language, with a prototype-instance
  object system, lexically scoped procedures, dynamic typing, and a rich class
  library. </p>
  
<p>Because Chickenfoot uses Javascript, web developers can easily transfer their
  knowledge of Javascript from web page development over to Chickenfoot. Chickenfoot
  predefines the same variables available to Javascript in web pages - e.g.,
  <tt>window</tt>, <tt>document</tt>, <tt>location</tt>, <tt>frames</tt>, <tt>history</tt> -
  so that Javascript code written for inclusion <em>inside </em> a web page can
  also be used as a Chickenfoot script <em>outside </em> the web page. Javascript
  has its own ways of visiting new pages (<tt>location</tt>), manipulating form controls
  (<tt>document.forms</tt>), and modifying page content (using the Document Object Model,
  or DOM ?). These
  mechanisms can be used by Chickenfoot scripts in addition to the Chickenfoot
  commands described in the next few sections. We have found that using the native
  Javascript mechanisms generally require reading and understanding a web page's
  HTML source. But by providing access to them, Chickenfoot provides a smooth
  escape mechanism for script developers that need to do something more low-level. </p>

<p>All current web browsers, including Firefox, implement a security model for
  Javascript to protect web users from malicious downloaded scripts. A major
  part of this security model is the <em>same-origin policy </em>, which prevents
  Javascript code downloaded from one web server from manipulating a web page
  downloaded from a different server. This restriction is clearly too severe
  for Chickenfoot, since its primary purpose is integrating and customizing multiple
  web sites. As a result, Chickenfoot scripts run at a privileged level, where
  they have access to the entire web browser, all pages it visits, and the user's
  filesystem and network. Users must trust Chickenfoot code as much as they trust
  any other desktop application. As a result, Chickenfoot scripts cannot be embedded
  in downloadable web pages like other Javascript. But Chickenfoot code <em>can </em> inject
  new behavior into downloaded pages, which is explained in more detail later. </p>

<h4 id="pattern">Pattern Matching <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>
<p>Pattern matching is a fundamental operation in Chickenfoot. To operate on
  a web page component, most commands take a pattern describing that page component.<br />
  Chickenfoot supports two kinds of patterns: <em>keyword patterns </em> and <em>text
  constraint patterns </em>. A keyword pattern consists of a string of keywords
  that are searched in the page to locate a page component, followed by the type
  of the component to be found. For example, <tt>"Search form"</tt> matches a
  form containing the keyword Search, and <tt>"Go button"</tt> matches a button
  with the word Go in
  its label. The component type is one of a small set of primitive names, including
  <tt>link</tt>, <tt>button</tt>, <tt>textbox</tt>, <tt>checkbox</tt>, <tt>radiobutton</tt>, <tt>listbox</tt>, and <tt>table</tt>. When
  a keyword pattern is used by a form manipulation command, the type of page
  component is implicit and can be omitted. For example, <tt>click("Go")</tt> searches
  for a hyperlink or button with the keyword "Go" in its label. Case is not significant,
  so <tt>click("go")</tt> has the same effect. </p>

<p>A text constraint pattern combines a library of primitive patterns (such as
  <tt>link</tt>, <tt>textbox</tt>, or <tt>paragraph</tt>), literal strings (such
  as <tt>"Go"</tt>), and relational
  operators (e.g., <tt>in</tt>, <tt>contains</tt>, <tt>just before</tt>, <tt>just
  after</tt>, <tt>starts</tt>, <tt>ends</tt>).
  Text constraint patterns have been described in more detail previously. Text
  constraint patterns are generally used to identify parts of a page for modification
  and extraction, although they can also be used for form manipulation. </p>

<p>The <tt>find</tt> command takes a pattern of either kind and searches for it in the
  current page, e.g.: </p>

<pre>  find("Search form") 
  find("link in bold") </pre>

<p><tt>find</tt> returns a <tt>Match</tt> object which represents the first match to the pattern
  and provides access to the rest of the matches. Here are some common idioms
  using <tt>find</tt> : </p>

<pre>  // test whether a pattern matches
  if (find(<em>pattern </em>).hasMatch) { ... }
  // count number of matches
  find(<em>pattern </em>).count
  // iterate through all matches
  for (m=find(<em>pattern </em>); m.hasMatch;m = m.next) { ... } </pre>

<p>A <tt>Match</tt> object represents a contiguous region of a web page, so it also provides
  properties for extracting that region. If <tt>m</tt> is a <tt>Match</tt> object, then <tt>m.text</tt>  returns the plain text it represents - i.e., the text that would be obtained
  by copying that region of the rendered web page and pasting it to a text editor
  that ignored formatting. Similarly, <tt>m.html</tt> returns the source HTML of the region,
  which is useful for extracting the region with formatting intact. Finally,
  <tt>m.element</tt> returns the DOM <tt>Element</tt> object represented by the region, if the
  region contains a single outermost element. This <tt>element</tt> can be used to get
  and set element attributes, e.g.: </p>

<pre>  find("link").element.href </pre>

<p>The <tt>find</tt> command is not only a global procedure, but also a method of <tt>Match</tt>  and <tt>Document</tt>. Invoking <tt>find</tt> on one of these objects constrains it to return
  only matches within the page or part of a page represented by the object. Here
  are some common idioms: </p>

<pre>// nested finds
  for (t=find("table"); t.hasMatch; t = t.next) {
    r = t.find("row");
    ...
  }

  // find in a page not currently showing
  otherDocument.find(<em>pattern</em>) </pre>

<h4 id="forms">Clicking and Form Manipulation <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>

<p>The next few commands allow Chickenfoot scripts to click on hyperlinks and
  fill in and submit forms. </p>

<p>The <tt>click</tt> command takes a pattern describing a hyperlink or button on the
  current page and causes the same effect as if the user had clicked on it. For
  example, these commands click on various parts of the Google home page: </p>

<pre>  click("Advanced Search") // a hyperlink
  click("I'm Feeling Lucky") // a button </pre>

<p>Keyword patterns do not need to exactly match the label of the button or hyperlink,
  but they do need to be unambiguous. Thus, <tt>click("Lucky")</tt> would suffice to match
  the I'm Feeling Lucky button, but in this case, <tt>click("Search")</tt> would be ambiguous
  between the Google Search button and the Advanced Search link, and hence would
  throw an exception. (Exact matches take precedence over partial matches, however,
  so if there were a single button labeled "Search", then the <tt>click</tt> command would
  succeed.) Buttons and links labeled by an image can be matched by keywords
  mentioned in their ALT text, if any. The keyword matching algorithm is described
  in more detail later in this paper. </p>

<p>The <tt>click</tt> command can take a <tt>Match</tt> object instead of a pattern, if the button
  or hyperlink to be clicked has already been found. For example, to identify
  a button using a text constraint pattern, the user might write this: </p>

<pre>  click(find("button just after textbox")) </pre>

<p>The <tt>enter</tt> command enters a value into a textbox. Like <tt>click</tt>, it
  takes a keyword pattern to identify the textbox, but in this case, the keywords
  are taken from the textbox's caption or other visible labels near the textbox.
  For example, to interact with the Amazon login page, a script might say: </p>

<pre>  enter("e-mail address", "rm@mit.edu")
  enter("password", password) </pre>

<p>When the page contains only one textbox in the page, which is often true for
  search forms, the keyword pattern can be omitted. For example, this sequence
  does a search on Google: </p>

<pre>  enter("uist 2005") 
  click("Google Search") </pre>

<p>Checkboxes and radio buttons are controlled by the <tt>check</tt> and <tt>uncheck</tt> commands,
  which take a keyword pattern that describes the checkbox: </p>

<pre>  check("Yes, I have a password") 
  uncheck("Remember Me") </pre>

<p>Finally, the <tt>pick</tt> command makes a selection from a listbox or drop-down box
  (which are both instantiations of the HTML <tt>&lt;select&gt;</tt> element). The simplest
  form of <tt>pick</tt> merely identifies the choice by a keyword pattern: </p>

<pre>  pick("California") </pre>

<p>If only one choice in any listbox or drop-down on the page matches the keywords
  (the common case), then that choice is made. If the choice is not unique, <tt>pick</tt>  can take two keyword patterns, the first identifying a listbox or dropdown
  by keywords from its caption, and the second identifying the choice within
  the listbox: </p>

<pre>  pick("State", "California") </pre>

<p>Like <tt>find</tt>, all the clicking and form manipulation commands are also
  methods of <tt>Match</tt> and <tt>Document</tt>. so that the keyword search can be constrained
  to a particular part of a page: </p>

<pre>  f = find("Directions form")
  f.enter("address", "32 Vassar St")
  f.enter("zip", "02139") 
  f.click("Get Directions") </pre>

<p>The form manipulation commands described so far permit setting the value of
  a form widget, which is the most common case for web automation. To read the
  current value of a widget, a script can use <tt>find</tt> to locate it, and then access
  the value of its <tt>Element</tt> object in conventional Javascript fashion, e.g.: </p>

<pre>  find("address textbox").element.value </pre>

<p>Chickenfoot also provides a <tt>reset</tt> command which resets a form to its default
  values, though reset is rarely needed. </p>

<h4 id="navigation">Navigation and Page Loading <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>

<p>In addition to loading pages by clicking on links and submitting forms, Chickenfoot
  scripts can jump directly to a URL using the <tt>go</tt> command: </p>

<pre>  go("http://www.google.com") </pre>

<p>If the string is not a valid URL, <tt>go</tt> automatically prefixes it with "http://". </p>

<p>Conventional browser navigation operations are also available as Chickenfoot
  commands: <tt>back</tt>, <tt>forward</tt>, and <tt>reload</tt>. </p>

<p>To retrieve a page without displaying it, the <tt>fetch</tt> command can be used. It
  returns a <tt>Document</tt> object representing the invisible page: </p>

<pre>  google = fetch("www.google.com") </pre>

<p>The Javascript <tt>with</tt> statement is convenient for performing a sequence of operations
  on an invisible page, by implicitly setting the context for Chickenfoot pattern
  matching and form manipulation: </p>

<pre>  with (fetch("www.google.com")) {
    enter("syzygy");
    click("Google Search");
    n = find("number just after about").text
  } </pre>

<p>Pages retrieved by <tt>fetch</tt>, <tt>go</tt>, or <tt>click</tt> are loaded
  asynchronously by the browser, while the Chickenfoot script continues to run.
  Thus, a script can fire off several <tt>fetch</tt> requests in parallel, without
  forcing each request to complete before the next one starts. When a subsequent
  Chickenfoot command needs to access the content of a page, such as <tt>find</tt>, the
  command automatically blocks until the page is fully loaded. The <tt>wait</tt> and <tt>ready</tt>  commands make this blocking available to programmatic control. Both commands
  take a <tt>Document</tt> object or an array of <tt>Documents</tt> as an argument. With no arguments,
  the default is the current page. <tt>Wait</tt> blocks until at least one of the specified
  pages is fully loaded, and returns that page. <tt>Ready</tt> returns a loaded page only
  if it has already completed, otherwise it immediately returns <tt>null</tt>. </p>

<h4 id="modification">Page Modification <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>

<p>Chickenfoot offers three primitive commands for changing the content of web
  pages: <tt>insert</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, and <tt>replace</tt>. </p>

<p>The <tt>insert</tt> command takes two arguments: a location on a page and a fragment
  of web page content that should be inserted at that location. In its simplest
  form, the location is a text constraint pattern, and the web page content is
  simply a string of HTML: </p>

<pre>  insert("just before textbox", "&lt;b&gt;Search: &lt;/b&gt;") </pre>

<p>The location can also be derived from a <tt>Match</tt> object, but it must represent
  a single point in the page, not a range of content. The <tt>before</tt> and <tt>after</tt> commands
  can be used to reduce one of these objects to a point: </p>

<pre>  t = find("textbox")
  insert(after(t), "&lt;b&gt;Search: &lt;/b&gt;") </pre>

<p>The page content to be inserted can also be a <tt>Match</tt> object, allowing content
  to be extracted from another page and inserted in this one: </p>

<pre>  map = mapquest.find("image")
  insert("just after Directions", map) </pre>

<p>The <tt>remove</tt> command removes page content identified by its argument, which
  can be a text constraint pattern or <tt>Match</tt> object. For example: </p>

<pre>  remove("Sponsored Links cell") </pre>

<p>The replace command replaces one chunk of page content with another. It is
  often used to wrap page content around an existing element: </p>

<pre>  keyword = find("syzygy")
  replace(keyword, "&lt;b&gt;"+keyword+"&lt;/b&gt;") </pre>

<h4 id="widgets">Widgets <a href="#home" title="back to top">^</a></h4>

<p>When a Chickenfoot script needs to present a user interface, it can create
  links and buttons and insert them directly into a web page. Hyperlinks are
  created by the <tt>Link</tt> constructor, which takes a chunk of HTML to display inside
  the hyperlink and an event handler to run when the link is clicked: </p>

<pre>  new Link("&lt;b&gt;Show All&lt;/b&gt;", showAll) </pre>

<p>The event handler can be either a string of Chickenfoot code (like the <tt>onclick</tt>  attribute
  in HTML) or a Javascript function object. Buttons are created similarly by
  the <tt>Button</tt> constructor. </p>

<p>Other widgets can be created by inserting HTML, e.g.: </p>

<pre>  insert(..., "&lt;input type=checkbox&gt;") </pre>

<p>If an <tt>onclick</tt> attribute is included in this HTML element, however, the code
  it contains will execute like conventional, untrusted Javascript code downloaded
  with the page. Commands defined by Chickenfoot would be unavailable to it.
  To add a Chickenfoot handler to a button created from HTML, one can use the
  <tt>onClick</tt> command: </p>

<pre>  onClick(button, showAll) </pre>
</dl>



<!--
<h4>Development Environment </h4>

<p>Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the development environment presented by the
  current Chickenfoot prototype, which appears as a sidebar in Firefox. At the
  top of the sidebar is a text editor used to compose Chickenfoot code, which
  may be merely a single expression or command to execute, or a larger program
  with function and class definitions. This simple interface goes a long way
  toward making the Javascript interpreter embedded in every web browser accessible
  to the user. Previously, there were only two ways to run Javascript in a web
  browser: by embedding it in a web page (generally impossible if the page is
  fetched from a remote web site, since the user can't edit it), or by using
  a <em>javascript: </em> URL, which requires the entire program to be written
  on a single line. The Chickenfoot sidebar makes it much easier for an end-user
  to write and run scripts. </p>

<p>The bottom of the sidebar has four tabbed panels. First, the Debug panel is
  an output window that displays error messages, output printed by the Chickenfoot
  debug command, and the result of evaluating the Chickenfoot script (i.e., the
  value of the last expression).</p>

<p>The Actions panel (not yet implemented) will display a history of browsing
    actions performed by the user, constantly updated as the user browses the
    web. This panel will enable self-disclosure ?[4]. displaying the Chickenfoot
    commands that would reproduce the user's actions. A manual browsing sequence
    can be used as the basis for a script by selecting it in the Actions pane
    and copying it into the script editor. </p>

<p>The Patterns panel displays an interface for developing text constraint patterns,
  which allows the user to type in a pattern and see what it matches in the current
  page. This pane also displays the primitive patterns available in the text
  constraints pattern library. </p>

<p>Finally, the Triggers panel allows a Chickenfoot script to be installed into
  the browser for regular use. For manual invocation, a script can be installed
  as a bookmark, which appears like any other bookmark in the Bookmarks menu
  and toolbar. For automatic invocation, a script can be associated with a <em>trigger </em>,
  which is a URL pattern such as http://www.amazon.com/*. Whenever a page is
  loaded, if its URL matches a trigger, then the associated script executes automatically.
  If a page matches multiple triggers, the associated scripts execute in the
  fixed order given by the Triggers pane. The Triggers pane provides an interface
  for adding and removing triggered scripts, temporarily disabling triggers,
  and viewing errors in automatically triggered scripts. </p>
