<a href="http://programmingclosure.com/closure-lite/">Closure Lite</a> is a
single JavaScript file that contains the core APIs of the
<a href="http://code.google.com/closure/library/">Closure Library</a>.
To see which Closure APIs it includes, see the official
<a href="http://www.programmingclosure.com/closure-lite/#api">API documentation</a>.

<p/>

Closure Lite can also be used when prototyping web applications
(that do not involve Chickenfoot), though the
Closure Library is recommended for production code. See the
<a href="http://www.programmingclosure.com/closure-lite/#usage">Closure Lite
usage instructions</a> for details.
