<h3>Library: google-ajax-search.js</h3>

The <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/">Google Search API</a> is
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/">well-documented</a>,
but there are two important caveats when using the Chickenfoot wrapper for the API:

<ol>
  <li>The wrapper uses <code>fetch()</code>, so currently, it only works on MS Windows.<span class="firered">*</span>
  <li>This library requires that you have a Google AJAX Search API license key,
     which you can get for free from
     <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/">http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/</a>.
     Once you have a key, the simplest way to use it with the wrapper is to go to <b>about:config</b>
     in Firefox, create a string preference named <b>google.GoogleAjaxSearchLicenseKey</b>,
     and use your API key as its value. Alternatively, you can redefine
     <code>getGoogleAjaxSearchLicenseKey()</code> in the library. See the
     <a href="libraries/google-ajax-search.js">source code</a> for more details.
</ol>

Assuming you have your license key in place, here is a simple sample that uses the API in Chickenfoot:

<pre>
// import the library
include("google-ajax-search.js");

with (window) {
  // create the search control
  var searchControl = new GSearchControl();
  searchControl.addSearcher(new GwebSearch());
  
  // create a place to insert the search control in the page
  var div = document.createElement("DIV");
  document.body.appendChild(div);
  
  // render the search control
  searchControl.draw(div);
}
</pre>

<p/>

Again, the official documentation contains
<a href="http://localhost/chickenfoot/libraries/google-ajax-search.html">a number of examples</a>
to demonstrate how to take full advantage of the API.

<p/>

<span class="firered">*</span>For the determined Mac and Linxu hackers,
this wrapper could likely be made to work on those OSes using <code>whenLoaded()</code>,
though that would make the library slightly less convenient to use since it would
have to use callback functions.
We are working to improve Chickenfoot so that <code>whenLoaded()</code>
is not necessary on those platforms.
