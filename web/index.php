<h3>Overview</h3>

Chickenfoot is a Firefox extension that puts a programming environment in the browser's sidebar
so you can write scripts to manipulate web pages and automate web browsing.
In Chickenfoot, scripts are written in a superset of Javascript
that includes special functions specific to web tasks.

<b>No Firefox 4 support yet:</b> the latest version of Chickenfoot on this site runs only on Firefox 3.  Chickenfoot is no longer under active development at MIT, so the <a href="developer-info.html">source code</a> will be moving to a github repository for further development, including Firefox 4 support among other goals.  If you want to help with the future development of Chickenfoot, please send mail to <a href="mailto:bolinfest@gmail.com">Michael Bolin</a>.
